| What is DOM?                        | The Document Object Model represents the HTML elements as a tree-like structure which we can modify using JavaScript. |
| What is `innerHTML`?                | A property that allows us to read or write the HTML content inside an element.                                        |
| What does `slice()` do?             | Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.                                 |
| How does pagination work here?      | We display 4 items per page by slicing the product array from the start index to end index based on the current page. |
| What is `window.onload` used for?   | It ensures that the renderTable function is executed only after the DOM is fully loaded.                              |
| Why did you use a separate JS file? | To separate logic from structure, making the code modular, maintainable, and reusable.                                |
